************<strong>HTML and Its Elements</strong>*************
<br>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet.
It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has 
evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).

HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.
